Role Variables
==============

This role has many variables values that can be changed to best suit your
needs.

Below are listed all the variables you can customize (you may also want to
take a look at `the default values of these variables
<https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/blob/master/defaults/main.yml>`__).

**Note**: The default values for settings provided to control the number
of process and threads of uWSGI and Daphne are set conservatively. It is
expected from user to update these settings to suit scale of their
project. The same thing applies for concurrency and autoscale settings for
celery workers.

Install OpenWISP for Testing in a VirtualBox VM
===============================================

If you want to try out OpenWISP in your own development environment, the
safest way is to use a VirtualBox Virtual Machine (from here on VM).

Using Vagrant
-------------

**Since August 2018 there's a new fast and easy way to install OpenWISP
for testing purposes** leveraging `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com>`__,
a popular open source tool for building and maintaining portable virtual
software development environments.

To use this new way, clone the repository `vagrant-openwisp2
<https://github.com/openwisp/vagrant-openwisp2>`__, it contains the
instructions (in the ``README.md``) and the vagrant configuration to
perform the automatic installation.

Alternatively, you can read on to learn how to install *VirtualBox* and
run *ansible-openwisp2* manually, this is useful if you need to test
advanced customizations of *OpenWISP*.

Installing Debian 11 on VirtualBox
----------------------------------

Install `VirtualBox <https://virtualbox.org>`__ and create a new Virtual
Machine running Debian 11. A step-by-step guide is available `here
<http://www.brianlinkletter.com/installing-debian-linux-in-a-virtualbox-virtual-machine/>`__,
however we need to change a few things to get ansible working.

VM Configuration
----------------

Proceed with the installation as shown in the guide linked above, and come
back here when you see this screen:

.. figure:: ../images/debian-software-selection.png
    :target: ../../_images/debian-software-selection.png
    :alt: Screenshot of the Software Selection screen

We're only running this as a server, so you can uncheck ``Debian desktop
environment``. Make sure ``SSH server`` and ``standard system utilities``
are checked.

Next, add a `Host-only Network Adapter
<https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly>`__ and
assign an IP address to the VM.

- On the Main VirtualBox page, Go to ``File > Host Network Manager``
- Click the + icon to create a new adapter
- Set the IPv4 address to ``192.168.56.1`` and the IPv4 Network Mask to
  ``255.255.255.0``. You may need to select ``Configure Adapter Manually``
  to do this. The IPv6 settings can be ignored

  .. image:: ../images/host-only-network.png
      :target: ../../_images/host-only-network.png
      :alt: Screenshot of the Host-only network configuration screen

- Shut off your VM
- In your VM settings, in the Network section, click Adapter 2 and Enable
  this Adapter
- Select Host-only adapter and the name of the adapter you created
- Boot up your VM, run ``su``, and type in your superuser password
- Run ``ls /sys/class/net`` and take note of the output
- Run ``nano /etc/network/interfaces`` and add the following at the end of
  the file:

  .. code-block:: text

      auto enp0s8
      iface enp0s8 inet static
          address 192.168.56.2
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          network 192.168.56.0
          broadcast 192.168.56.255

  Replace ``enp0s8`` with the network interface not present in the file
  but is shown when running ``ls /sys/class/net``

- Save the file with CtrlO then Enter, and exit with CtrlX
- Restart the machine by running ``reboot``

Make sure you can access your VM via ssh:

.. code-block:: shell

    ssh 192.168.56.2

Back to your local machine
--------------------------

Proceed with these steps in your **local machine**, not the VM.

**Step 1**: :ref:`Install ansible <ansible_install>`

**Step 2**: :ref:`Install the OpenWISP2 role for Ansible
<ansible_install_role>`

**Step 3**: :ref:`Set up a working directory
<ansible_choose_working_directory>`

**Step 4**: Create the ``hosts`` file

Create an ansible inventory file named ``hosts`` **in your working
directory** (i.e. not in the VM) with the following contents:

.. code-block::

    [openwisp2]
    192.168.56.2

**Step 5**: Create the ansible playbook

In the same directory where you created the ``host`` file, create a file
named ``playbook.yml`` which contains the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: openwisp2
      roles:
        - openwisp.openwisp2
      # the following line is needed only when an IP address is used as the inventory hostname
      vars:
          postfix_myhostname: localhost

**Step 6**: Run the playbook

.. code-block:: shell

    ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml -b -k -K --become-method=su

When the playbook ran successfully, you can log in at
``https://192.168.56.2/admin`` with the following credentials:

.. code-block:: text

    username: admin
    password: admin
